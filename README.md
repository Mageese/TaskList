# My Personal Project

## Collage Board Maker

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

The project will be a to-do list. One can use it track a list of tasks they need to do or
keep track of midterm and final dates. 
This project is something I can use in my life.
