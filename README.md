# My Personal Project

## Collage Board Maker

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

The project will be collage board maker. Anyone can use it, if you need to compile photos
for a project, this maker may be useful as well. This project is something I can use in my life.
